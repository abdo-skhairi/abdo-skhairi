Hi, I'm Abdo (Abde Rahmane Skhairi) ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate beginner in the development domain, currently diving into the world of programming. I've been fascinated by coding since childhood and am eager to improve my skills in the field. I primarily work with C and Python, and I've already completed a few projects. My goal is to grow into a more professional developer in the future.

I study at 1337 School in Tetuan, Morocco (42 network), and at the same time, I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Abdelmalek Essaadi University, also in Tetuan.

Beyond coding, I'm also a music producer and sound engineer, though I focus mainly on programming these days!

Feel free to check out my work and connect with me!
